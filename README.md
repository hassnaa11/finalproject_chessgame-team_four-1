# **Chess Game**
This is a multiplayer chess game. First you enter your username and password and if you don’t have a one you can create a new account then you enter the players’ name and the time of the game you want. So our chess game has the same rules as the regular chess game but with some differences in the moves of some pieces.The eaten pieces of each player displayed on the sidebar. the game end when one of the players is checked or when the time of one of the player ended.

#### The difference in moves:
1. A Pawn captures (eats) the squares diagonally or the piece in front.
2. The Bishop (elephant) can only move three steps on the diagonal and bypass any pieces. The Bishop also has a new special move, which is to move one square on the horizontal axis so it changes the diagonal color.
3. The knight can move in an L shape, with two squares horizontally or vertically, and then three squares in the perpendicular direction.
4. The valid moves are highlighted green and the illegal move highlighted red.
